# weather-dashboard

## Function
This website is a weather dashboard that allows the user to search for the daily weather data and 5 day forecast of the city of their choice. After typing in their city into the input bar and pressing the search button, the right side is populated with the city name, and the day's temperature, humidity, wind speed, and uv index, as well as an icon that displays the current cloud coverage. Underneath this are 5 cards that display the next 5 day's dates, temperatures, humidities, and cloud cover icons. The city the user searched for is added to a clickable list beneath the search bar that the user can click on again to repopulate that city's data. The last city the user searches for, either by search bar or clicking on a previous city, is saved into local storage and appears whenever the user refreshes or closes and reopens the page.
